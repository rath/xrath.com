**How Much Sleep Do I Need?**

Most adult people seem to need seven to nine hours of sleep a night. This is an average, and it is also subjective. You, for example, probably know how much sleep you need in an average night to feel your best. 

The amount of sleep you need decreases with age. A newborn baby might sleep 20 hours a day. By age four, the average is 12 hours a day. By age 10, the average falls to 10 hours a day. Senior citizens can often get by with six or seven hours a day. 

**Tips to Improve Your Sleep**

- Exercise regularly. Exercise helps tire and relax your body. 
- Don't consume caffeine after 4:00 p.m. or so. Avoid other stimulants like cigarettes as well. 
- Avoid alcohol before bedtime. Alcohol disrupts the brain's normal patterns during sleep. 
- Try to stay in a pattern with a regular bedtime and wakeup time, even on weekends.

지금 시간 2시 30분. 오늘은 블랙커피 2잔으로 끝이다.
매일 오후 4시에 담배를 펴버릇해야겠다 (7)

자기파괴적인 행동이겠지만, 다음날 중요한 약속이 있을때 수면의 질을 떨어트리기 위해 소주 한병 들이키는 것도 좋을 것 같다.

과음 후 7시간 수면 - 오전에 구토, 오후에 업무버닝, 저녁에 맥주 한캔 - 6시간 수면 - 중간에 2번 깸, 아침에 일어나는데 5분간 사투. 

아 정리해보니, 수면부족 맞구나 -_-;
