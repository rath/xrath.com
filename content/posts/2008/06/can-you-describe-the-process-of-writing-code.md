2008 JavaOne Conference 에서 [Chet Haase 씨 인터뷰 내용](http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/2008/articles/rockstar_chethaase.jsp) 중 재미있고 인상 깊은 것 몇 개.



```
Q: What do you see as the most important API in Java five years from now?

A: There will never be a more useful API than System.out.println.
```


```
Q: Can you describe the process of writing code?

A: I try to collect in my mind, and maybe in illegible notes on scrap pieces of paper that I can never locate afterwards, some concept of what the system will do. Then I start prototyping.

There's an ideal approach that I've seen described in books where you specify an entire system -- API, whatever -- in function stubs and comments, and then all you have to do is fill in the details. Maybe some people actually code this way, but I haven't met them.

Much of software is a research project, where it's not clear what is possible or how the details will actually need to work. So when I get close to knowing what I want to achieve, then I start hacking some code to find out what is going to work and how. As I get the smaller pieces working, I can refine the design because I have a better idea of what will actually work.
```


```
Q: What do you do when you feel stumped?

A: Pick up a pen and paper and think through the problem. Take a walk. Talk to someone else about it. Or have another cup of coffee -- it may not help, but it tastes good.
```
